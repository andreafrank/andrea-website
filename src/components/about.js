					Hi - Iâ€™m Andrea, and this website the result of my first day of #100DaysofCode. Iâ€™m adding new features 
					and building this out every day. Up next is more responsive design, React functionality, and soon, some 
					ThreeJS visuals.

					I attended DevBootcamp a few years ago before it closed (ripðŸ¥º) got a bad case of imposter syndrome 
					and an unrelated job, and stopped programming. I enrolled in MICAâ€™s MPS UX program earlier this year, 
					and once I dipped my toes back into tech, ohhhhh did my passion for programming re-ignite. Iâ€™m finishing 
					the program and graduate in May 2021, but am aligning my focus back to finding a full stack or front end 
					position where I can both grow as a programmer and help interface with the UX folks and integrate teams. 
				</div>

				<div>
					In my free time, I haveâ€¦ a lot of hobbies. I like being outside, cooking (especially Thai food), sewing & 
					pattern drafting, which, in terms of problem-solving and algorithmic thinking, has quite a lot in common 
					with programming.

					<div>Tomorrow, I will build functionality and content for the Navbar links and create a contact form.</div>
