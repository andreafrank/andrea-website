				Hi - Iâ€™m Andrea, and this website the result of my first day of #100DaysofCode. Iâ€™m adding new features and building this out every day so please visit back often. Up next is more React functionality and soon, some ThreeJS visuals. 
				<br />
				<br />
				I attended DevBootcamp a few years ago before it closed (ripðŸ¥º) got a bad case of imposter syndrome and an unrelated job, and stopped programming. I enrolled in MICAâ€™s MPS UX program earlier this year, and once I dipped my toes back into tech, ohhhhh did my passion for programming re-ignite. Iâ€™m finishing the program and graduate in May 2021, but am aligning my focus back to finding a full stack or front end position where I can both grow as a programmer and help interface with the UX folks and integrate teams. Hire me!  
				<br />
				<br />
				In my free time, I haveâ€¦ a lot of hobbies. I like being outside, cooking (especially Thai food), sewing & pattern drafting, which, in terms of problem-solving and algorithmic thinking, has quite a lot in common with programming.
